# Purpose

The purpose of meeting students on placement is to find out 

1. Find out what they have been doing
2. Get students to reflect on what they've done well (with their manager)
3. Get students to reflect on what they could (with their manager)

## What have you been doing?

* Tell me about your employer and the products or services they provide
* Which products or services have you been working on 
* What methodologies and tools have you been using 
* What have you been surprised by since you started work?

## What went well (WWW)? 

* What  is going well? 
* Are there any projects or achievements you are particularly proud of (ask student first, then their manager) 
* What skills or knowledge have you managed to build so far?

## Even Better If (EBI)?

* What areas have you identified for improvement in the future (ask student first, then their manager)
* How are you planning to develop these skills

Depending on the time of the visit, you may also want to remind them about proposing their own project (or picking one from the project book)
