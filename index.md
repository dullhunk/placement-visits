# Purpose

The purpose of meeting undergraduate Computer Science students on placement is to:

1. Find out what they have been doing
2. Get students to reflect on what they've done well (with their manager)
3. Get students to reflect on what they could do better (with their manager)

Most employers can do these visits remotely via Zoom or Microsoft Teams.

Once you've visited your tutees, please fill in the short form at [forms.office.com/r/7ULi1Qbuhc](https://forms.office.com/r/7ULi1Qbuhc) (UoM login required) to capture this information and so that we know which students have been visited. The meetings usually last somewhere between 20 and 30 minutes.


## What have you been doing?

* Tell me about your employer and the products or services they provide?
* Which products or services have you been working on? 
* What methodologies and tools have you been using ?
* What have you been surprised by since you started work?

## What went well (WWW)? 

* What is going well? 
* Are there any projects or achievements you are particularly proud of (ask student first, then their manager) 
* What skills or knowledge have you managed to build so far (include soft & hard skills)?

## Even Better If (EBI)?

* What areas have you identified for improvement in the future (ask student first, then their manager)
* How are you planning to develop these skills? Include soft & hard skills
* Are there any other things you want to work on before the placement finishes?

## Any other business?

Depending on the time of the visit, you may also want to remind the student about proposing their own project (or picking one from the project book)

## Placement report?
The type of placement report you write depends on your degree program

* For Bachelors students, there's a self explanatory template at https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/industrial-placement-report/vcjymrgmcpzh
* For MEng students, speak to the MEng tutor, Tim Morris https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/tim.morris
